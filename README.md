- Build a Portfolio Site : Given a pdf mockup of a website from a designer, translate it to a real website using your HTML and CSS skills.

- Online Resume : Once you've mastered the skills of a front end web developer you'll want to make a great first impression. You need a resume that stands out. The resume you build will not only help you build important skills, but will also make it easy to show employers why you’re perfect for the job. As you progress through this Nanodegree program you can update this resume with your new skills and projects.

- Classic Arcade Game Clone : You will be provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

- Neighbourhood Map : I will develop a single-page application featuring a map of my neighbourhood or a neighbourhood I would like to visit.

- Feed Reader Testing : In this project I am given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The application has an incomplete test suite. I will complete and test the suite using jasmine as a behavior-driven development framework.
