# Project: Parallax

## Description

This is pratice on a parallax scrolling site. Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling. I refered [before parallax scrolling desigin](https://codepen.io/egoing/pen/yaKvPd?editors=1100). I used css featured that background and transform.

## Built with

HTML, CSS

## Installation

1. You can download the repository from
[prePF/Parallax/](https://github.com/leiachung41/prePF/tree/master/Parallax/).
2. Find a index.html file in the repository, and open the index.html file in a browser.

*Or you can connect to the application via online here [Parallax](https://leiachung41.github.io/prePF/Parallax/index.html).*

## How to use?

  - Just scroll a site and you can feel the difference between this [before site](https://leiachung41.github.io/prePF/Parallax/before/index_B4.html). The backgound image is not following your scrolling and it is fixed.
