#  Project Overview
In this project you will write the JavaScript that powers your own online resume.

This project is meant to be completed while taking the JavaScript Basics course. Throughout the course you'll build your resume by writing JavaScript that will combine your personal information with pre-written HTML and CSS templates to generate your resume.

## Note
If you have successfully completed the project for the JavaScript Basics course in the past (which entails having graduated from the course and having access to your course certificate), simply email us at frontend-project@udacity.com with your passing evaluation and we'll give you credit for this project.

# Why this Project?
Once you've mastered the skills of a front end web developer you'll want to make a great first impression. You need a resume that stands out.

The resume you build will not only help you build important skills, but will also make it easy to show employers why you’re perfect for the job. As you progress through this nanodegree you can update this resume with your new skills and projects.

# What will I Learn?
You will learn basic JavaScript syntax, which includes manipulating data, building loops and creating functions. At the same time, you’ll learn some simple jQuery DOM manipulation methods to build your resume the moment a user opens your website.

# How does this Help my Career?
- It's a resume. Resumes help you get jobs.
- JavaScript is the language of web development.
- JavaScript lets you turn static web pages into dynamic applications.
- Since it runs on normal web browsers, JavaScript is one of the most accessible and flexible programming languages.

# How do I Complete this Project?
All of the lessons you'll need to help you build this can be found in the lessons in this part of your Nanodegree program.

Depending on your background knowledge of HTML and CSS, you may not need to complete all lessons to build this project. To evaluate what you'll need to know, start by downloading the mockup we've provided, and review the [Project Rubric](https://github.com/leiachung41/prePF/tree/master/Online_Resume/rubric.pdf).

Be sure to follow the Project Rubric closely when designing your page. For example, note that [HTML5 semantic (structural) elements](https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML_structural_elements#Enter_HTML5_structural_elements) must be used to organize content.

Instructions:

1. Download the design mockup file from the Downloadables section (in the lower right hand corner of your screen, just below this text) and review it.

2. Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.

3. Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.

4. Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.

5. Validate your HTML and CSS against the [W3C's Validators](http://validator.w3.org/). Note: the validators consider the following errors, whereas Udacity accepts these errors as acceptable:
  
       1. HTML5: **Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta** when using the X-UA-Compatible meta tag.
       2. CSS3: **Property [some property here] is an unknown vendor extension** when using vendor prefixed properties (like -moz-box-sizing).
