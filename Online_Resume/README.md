# Project: Online Resume

## Description

I built my resume by writing <a href="https://leiachung41.github.io/prePF/Online_Resume/before/resumeBuilder_B4.js" target="_blank">resumeBuilder.js</a> JavaScript file that combined my personal information with pre-written <a href="https://leiachung41.github.io/prePF/Online_Resume/before/index_B4.html" target="_blank">index.html</a> and <a href="https://leiachung41.github.io/prePF/Online_Resume/before/style_B4.CSS" target="_blank">style.css</a> templates to generate my resume.
