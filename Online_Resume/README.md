# Project: Online Resume

## Description

I built my resume by writing [resumeBuilder.js](https://leiachung41.github.io/prePF/Online_Resume/before/resumeBuilder_B4.js) JavaScript file that combined my personal information with pre-written [index.html](https://leiachung41.github.io/prePF/Online_Resume/before/index_B4.html) and [style.css](https://leiachung41.github.io/prePF/Online_Resume/before/style_B4.CSS) templates to generate my resume.

## Features
