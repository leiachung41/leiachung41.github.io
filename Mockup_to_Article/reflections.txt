    * What new skills have you learned?
    I've learned some html tags before I didn't know. For example, <em>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <strike>, and <sup>.
    * What has been easy?
    Yes. Fortunately, It's not that difficult.
    * What has been difficult?
    It's using double tags. I didn't come up with using both <em> and <strong>.
    * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
    I tried to find it every other way when I got problems. I also searched MDN and w3school pages.
