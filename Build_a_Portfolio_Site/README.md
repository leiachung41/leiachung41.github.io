# Project: Build a Portfolio Site

## Description

For this project, I built a portfolio website. I was given a <a href="https://leiachung41.github.io/prePF/Build_a_Portfolio_Site/before/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf" target="_blank">design mockup</a> as a PDF-file, and replicated that design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects.
